        text: " With front-end experience, I undertook development, repair, and external enhancements for four major projects over a span of four months. These projects were done for important companies (Altınordu management system, Parolapara admin dashboard, Ucuzyolu website and E-invoice portal payment and management system). Through these experiences, I improved my coding and research skills, allowing for faster and more efficient development. In addition to coding, I also excelled in design by creating Figma prototypes with CSS, integrating Tailwind and Bootstrap. I demonstrated seamless teamwork and facilitated effective communication between back-end and front-end developers.",
